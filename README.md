I am a passionate, creative, flexible, and enthusiastic person who has improved myself through professional experiences, national and international projects, university-industry projects, internship and voluntary programs, and courses I participated in and aimed for continuous improvement. Also, abilities are gained through volunteering, international activities, and student clubs, communication skills, self-initiative, leadership, and working with various cultures. In addition, by being inquiring and willing to learn from others, I can improve myself in different fields and become a good leader in the future.

I am interested in decision intelligence, optimization, and artificial intelligence.
